# ABCD Sex Differences replication project

I did stuff

# Code Documentation:

### Part 1: Discovery and Replication sample generation
  > You'll need to change the save filename/paths in the script
  
  1. Run the [get_data_for_ridge.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/discovery%20and%20replication%20sample%20setup%20scripts/get_data_for_ridge.R) script created by Arielle Keller using the data in the `FilesForAdam` folder originally from `/cbica/projects/abcdfnets/scripts/FilesForAdam/`

  1. Next, run the [create_discovery_replication_set_siblings_removed.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/discovery%20and%20replication%20sample%20setup%20scripts/create_discovery_replication_sets_siblings_removed.py) script to create the final discovery and replication sets with the removal of siblings. These samples are used in subsequent steps.


### Part 2: Atlas Generation and Network Parcellation
  > Will need to change paths to discovery and replication datasets and the paths that you want to save the resulting files

  1. Run the [calc_group_average_mat.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/atlas_visualization/calc_group_average_mat.py) script to get the group average matrix for the networks for all of the subjects in the discovery and replication sets combined

  1. Run the [create_hard_parcel.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/atlas_visualization/get_subject_parcels.py) script to get the hard parcellations from networks 3, 4, and 12

  1. Run the [create_soft_parcel.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/atlas_visualization/get_subject_parcels.py) script to get the soft parcellations from networks 3, 4, and 12

  1. Run the [get_subject_parcels.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/atlas_visualization/get_subject_parcels.py) script to get the hard and soft parcellations for 4 random subjects with 2 subjects being male and 2 being female

### Part 3: Univariate Analysis
  1.  Use [convert_mat.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/discovery%20and%20replication%20sample%20setup%20scripts/convert_mat.py) to convert the final_UV.mat files into csvs

  _NOTE: This step can be skipped if you change the script to use `readMat` from the `R.Matlab` package instead of base R's `read.csv` function. However, you will have to setup a new singularity container with the necessary packages_

  2. Create a singularity container or use the one I created stored in `ashpfnsexdiffabcd/software/containers/` called `sex_differences_replication_0.0.3.sif`

  3. Change the filepaths for the results folder and subject data in the [abcd_unvariate_analysis.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/GAMs%20scripts/R%20scripts/abcd_univariate_analysis.R) script for the discovery data, which will run a GAM at each vertex to determine the effect of sex while controlling for age and motion. The script assumes that the subject data has siblings removed. Next, run the wrapper script [run_univariate_analysis.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/GAMs%20scripts/shell%20(job)%20wrappers/run_univariate_analysis.sh) via SGE using the following command:

  ```bash
  qsub -l h_vmem=25G,s_vmem=25G /cbica/projects/ash_pfn_sex_diff_abcd/dropbox/run_univariate_analysis.sh
  ```

  4. Similarly, do the same thing but for the replication data and use [abcd_unvariate_analysis_replication.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/GAMs%20scripts/R%20scripts/abcd_univariate_analysis.R) script and then run the wrapper script [run_univariate_replication.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/GAMs%20scripts/shell%20(job)%20wrappers/run_univariate_replication.sh) via SGE using the following command:

  ```bash
  qsub -l h_vmem=25G,s_vmem=25G /cbica/projects/ash_pfn_sex_diff_abcd/dropbox/run_univariate_replication.sh
  ```

  5. Once the gams models have been run, create the unthresholded absolute sum map from the results using the [write_effect_map_abs_sum.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/workbench%20setup%20scripts/write_effect_map_abs_sum.py) script. You'll need to change the arguments in the two function calls in the main execution block of the script.

  6. Convert the file obtained from the previous step into a CIFTI format to be loaded into workbench by using the [write_effect_map_to_cifti.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/workbench%20setup%20scripts/write_effect_map_to_cifti.py). 

  _NOTE: The script uses a dscalar.nii file of the fslr format as a temporary header to make the new CIFTI file. It is only used to structure the file._
  
  The script can be run like the following example command:

  ```bash
  python3 write_effect_map_to_cifti.py '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/multivariate_analysis/svm_072324_run/abs_sum_weight_brain_mat_discovery_haufe_100_runs_072324.npy' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/multivariate_analysis/svm_072324_run/svm_discovery_abs_sum_haufe_weights_072324.dscalar.nii'
  ```

  7. Load the resulting dscalar.nii file from the previous step into workbench to get the visualization.

  8. To get the significant veritces barplot, first run the [make_barplot_mat.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/barplot%20scripts/make_barplot_mat.py) script to get a matrix of the significant vertices for each network.

  9. Use the [create_barplot.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/barplot%20scripts/create_barplot.R) to get the barplot of significant vertices for each network. I ran this in Rstudio.

  10. To create the significant vertices for networks 3, 9, and 12, use the [get_individual_network_mat.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/univariate_analysis/individual%20network%20scripts/get_individual_network_mat.py) script to get each individual network from the matrix in the previous step.


### Part 4: Multivariate Analysis
  1. Run [create_nonzero_matrix.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/nonzero%20matrix%20creation%20scripts/create_nonzero_matrix.py) to setup the non-zero features matrix for subsequent steps. 

  2. Next, run [run_2fold_svm_resmulti_times_parallel_w_ROC.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20scripts/python%20scripts/run_2fold_svm_resmulti_times_parallel_w_ROC.py) by running the wrapper script [svm_resmulti_times_parallel_w_ROC_slurm.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20scripts/shell%20(job)%20wrappers/svm_resmulti_times_parallel_w_ROC_slurm.sh). The wrapper script submits an array job of size 100 which will run the `run_2fold` script 100 times (each run as a separate job) via slurm. The svm script runs 2 fold cross validation using the nonzero features matrix to predict sex using SVM. Run the following command to run the script:

  ```bash
  sbatch svm_resmulti_times_parallel_w_ROC_slurm.sh
  ```

  3.  Create the weight matrix by taking the mean of each of the coefficients from all the fold instances and save this weight matrix using the [svm_workbench_visualization_multi_times_matrix.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20workbench%20visualization/svm_workbench_visualization_multi_times_matrix.py) script. 

  4. Use the coefficient matrix created in the previous step in the [haufe_transform_weights.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/haufe%20transformation%20scripts/haufe_transform_weights.py) script to do a haufe transformation on the coefficients. Use the [haufe_transform_weights.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/haufe%20transformation%20scripts/haufe_transform_weights.sh) to run the script by running the following command: 

  ```bash
  qsub -l h_vmem=500G,s_vmem=500G haufe_transform_weights.sh
  ```

  5. Use the haufe transformed weight matrix from the previous step in the [svm_stacked_barplot.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20weights%20barplot/svm_stacked_barplot.R) script to get the stacked barplot of feature importance for both Males and Females. I ran this in Rstudio

  6. Use the haufe transformed weight matrix in the [sum_abs_weights_matrix.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20brain%20map%20plot/sum_abs_weights_matrix_svm.py) to get the absolute value sum of the weights and save this array.

  7. Use [write_effect_map_to_cifti_svm.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20brain%20map%20plot/write_effect_map_to_cifti_svm.py) to convert the matrix in the previous step into a CIFTI file format for visualization.

  8. Use the dscalar.nii file in workbench to get the visualization of the weights.

  9. In order to run the permutation tests, run the [svm_permutation_parallel.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20scripts/shell%20(job)%20wrappers/svm_permutation_parallel.sh) which calls the [svm_1000_permutation_scrambled_outcome_parallel.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/SVM%20scripts/python%20scripts/svm_1000_permutation_scrambled_outcome_parallel.py) script which scrambles the sex outcome variable and creates 1000 null models to compare to the accuracy of the 100 models. Use the following command to run the script: 

  ```bash
  sbatch svm_permutation_parallel.sh
  ```

  10. To generate the ROC curve, run the [create_ROC_curve.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/multivariate_analysis/roc_curve/create_ROC_curve.py) with the results from the 100 runs.

### Part 5: Genetics
  > The files generated from the steps below will be used in the enrichement analyses.

  1. Download files from [](https://github.com/PennLINC/S-A_ArchetypalAxis) to be used in the `flsr_to_fsaverage5.sh` script

  2. Use the [fslr_to_fsaverage5.sh](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/fslr_to_fsaverage5.sh) script to resample the gams uncorrected abs sum discovery data, gams uncorrected abs sum replication data, gams fdr abs sum discovery data, and gams fdr abs sum replication data from fslr to fsaverage5. Parameters include path to the map (dscalar.nii file) you're trying to resample to fsaverage5 space and the name that you want to label the resulting files. The file that you'll want to use in the enrichment analyses will end with `_LH.fsaverage5.func.gii`.
  
  Example command below:

  ```bash
  ./fslr_to_fsaverage5.sh /Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/univariate_analysis/univariate_analysis_results/uncorrected_abs_sum_matrix_discovery.dscalar.nii gams_uncorrected_discovery
  ```

  3. Download Download `AHBAProcessed.zip` and `AHBAData.zip` from [https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/AHBAdata/6852911](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/AHBAdata/6852911)   

  4. Read annotation file `AHBAData/data/genes/parcellations/lh.Schaefer1000_7net.annot` from figshare into R and use [read_gene_annot_files.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/read_gene_annot_files.R) to save the following files
      > save column 5 from `ct.table` as `lh_Schaefer1000_7net_cttable.csv`
      <br>  
      > save `L` as `lh_Schaefer1000_7net_L.csv`

  5. Save probe annotation file using `ROIxGene_Schaefer1000_INT.mat` and [create_probe_annotation.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/create_probe_annotation.py)
      > Save the filename as `GeneSymbol.csv`
  
  6. Grab the rest of the files needed for the scripts below from `/cbica/projects/ash_pfn_sex_diff_abcd/dropbox/genetics_files/` which originally came from the `abcdpfnsexdiff` project folder on cubic


### Chromosomal enrichment analysis
  1. Run the [ABCD_wSex_cor_gene_schaefer403_net7_discovery_20242108.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/chromosome_enrichment/ABCD_wSex_cor_gene_schaefer403_net7_discovery_20242108.R) script to get the chromosomal enrichments, recommend running this in Rstudio

  > Make sure to change the filepaths to use the files created above

  > Also make sure to change the filepaths for saving the intermediate files such as pvalues table and top 20 X chromosome genes

### Cell Type enrichment analysis
  1. Run the [cell_types_LAKE.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/celltype_enrichment/cell_types_LAKE.R) script to get the cell type enrichments, recommend running this in Rstudio

  > Make sure to change the filepaths to use the files created above
    
  > Also make sure to change the filepaths for saving the intermediate files such as pvalues table and top 20 tables for astro, ex5b, ex1, and oli

### PSP enrichment analysis
  1. Run the [PSP_plots.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/genetics/PSP_enrichment/PSP_plots.R) script to get the PSP enrichments, recommend running this in Rstudio

  > Make sure to change the filepaths to use the files created above and for the pvalue table

### Part 6: Spin tests
  1. Add medial wall back in to all of the data (gams uncorrected discovery abs sum, gams uncorrected replication abs sum, svm discovery abs sum haufe transformed, svm replication abs sum haufe transformed) using [add_medial_wall.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/add_medial_wall.R). Save results into csv that will later be converted into gii files.

  2. Use the [convert_to_gifti.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/convert_to_gifti.py) script to convert the data in the previous step into gii files. The following command can be run in terminal (the last argument indicated whether the data is from PNC or not): 

  ```bash
  python3 convert_to_gifti.py "medial_wall_maps/gams_discovery_medial_wall_map.csv" "results_gifti/gams_abs_sum_discovery_map.gii" N
  ```

  3. Run the [spin_test.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/spin_test.py) script using the converted gii files. The script can be run using the following example command:

  ```bash
  python3 spin_test.py '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/results_gifti/gams_abs_sum_discovery_map.gii' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/ abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/results_gifti/gams_abs_sum_replication_map.gii' "fsLR" 'Gams discovery vs replication' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/results'
  ```

  4. Once all spin tests have been completed, you can compile all of the results from the different tests as long as they are in the same folder by using the [compile_spin_tests.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/compile_spin_tests.py). The script can be run by calling the name of the script followed by the folder that the spin test results are stored in (might need to be the full path if the script is not in the same directory as the results):

  ```bash
  python3 compile_spin_tests.py spin_test_results_072524
  ```

  _The following instructions apply to the PNC data only_
  5. Grab the PNC gams abs sum data from `/cbica/projects/abcdpfnsexdiff/funcParcelSexDiff/inputData/spintest/`

  6. Convert the csv files of the gams abs sum LH and RH results into gii files using [convert_to_gifti.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/convert_to_gifti.py)

  ```bash
  python3 convert_to_gifti.py '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/PNC_data/GamSexAbssum_lh.csv' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/PNC_data/gams_abs_sum_lh.gii' Y
  ```

  7. Use the [PNC_to_fslr.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/PNC_to_fslr.py) to convert the PNC results to flsr space

  8. Run [spin_test.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/spin_tests/spin_test.py) using the following command:

  ```bash
  python3 spin_test.py '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/PNC_data/Gam_abs_sum_fslr_test.gii' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/ABCD_data/gams_abs_sum_discovery_uncorrected.gii' "fsLR" 'PNC gams discovery vs ABCD gams discovery fslr' '/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/results'
  ```
  
### Part 6: Other plots and figures
  1. To create the hex plots, use the [hex_plots.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/hex_plots/hex_plots.R) absolute sum matrices as arguments along with the data labels like the following command:

  ```bash
  Rscript hex_plots.R "/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/spin_tests/data/PNC_data/PNC_gams_abs_sum_all_fslr.csv" "PNC GAMs discovery loadings" "/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/univariate_analysis/univariate_analysis_results/uncorrected_abs_sum_matrix_discovery.csv" "ABCD GAMs discovery loadings" "/Users/ashfrana/Desktop/code/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/hex_plots/plots/pnc_gams_disc_vs_abcd_gams_disc_hex_plot.png"
  ```

  2. To create the figure s8 plot, use the data in the intermediate step of the significant vertices or svm weights barplots and run the [group_networks.py](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/figure_s8_barplots/group_networks.py) to group by netColor (or network group) and then use this data as input into [figure_s8_barplot.R](https://github.com/ashleychari/abcd_sex_pfn_replication/blob/main/figure_s8_barplots/figure_s8_barplot.R).
